# Experimental Go Websocket router & framework

Do not use.

</div>

Experimental framework for handling websockets in Go. Built on top of `gorrila/websockets`

Currently a standalone application, I hope to turn into a library 
that can be used by `net/http` compliant routers.

Design inspired by Phoenix Channels.
